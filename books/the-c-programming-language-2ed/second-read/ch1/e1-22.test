Here's a short line for you.
Let's try a very long line of input. It must be 80 characters, so I need to type some nonsense for a little while.

In order to get a longer line, I need to continue typing random nonsense. Here's a longer line which should wrap even further. All I need to do is continue spouting off about nothing in particular.

As a test, here's something with no spaces:
qkgvaniueoambvzlhaouinvmamvlheariouhvnaoifehajndlkjhlkjhkfhajhefanjkehfkjahkjfhklajdhlkjghiuehgiua

The final test is similar, but longer:
