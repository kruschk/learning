# learning
This repository is a collection of materials I've used to learn various topics
in computer science. For larger projects, such as working through a book, I'll
create a dedicated repository. This repository will likely only contain
materials from short tutorials, books that I don't get very far into, and the
like. That said, there's no hard-and-fast rule which dictates which materials
deserve their own repository, so there may be some flexibility here.
