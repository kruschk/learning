She wondered if Remedios might have tried getting her old job back, the one at the Bank of America on Woodside Road.
One day, she went there.
She stood in back of a long line of tired, impatient people.
It was 16:30, a Monday.
She waited patiently for the line to move.
And finally, finally, when she was at the front of the line, she forced herself to look up, to look carefully at the bank of tellers.
Her gaze went from girl to girl slowly.
That one had a face that was too square; that other one was too short; still another had a large mole by her lower lip.
When there was only the last girl in the row, she stopped and considered.
This girl had hair highlighted with gold and reddish streaks.
She’d covered her eyelids with glittery purple eyeshadow.
When her gaze stopped, the girl looked up.
For a moment, their eyes locked.
Then Remedios put her hand to her mouth and screamed.
