			<h2>What we do</h2>
			<p>At Roger's Pumpkin Emporium, we supply pumpkins. Our pumpkins are multi-purpose; they can be used for baking, halloween decorations, launching, or just about anything else you can imagine! To help you get as stoked as we are about pumpkins, here's a video of a pumpkin trebuchet in action:</p>

			<h2>Grow your own!</h2>
			<p>A little-known fact about pumpkins is that anyone can grow them! All that is required is some fertile soil, water, a green thumb, and a bit of patience. If you have pumpkins of your own, send them to us and they might be featured on our website (or potentially used for financial gain in our own marketing campaign). We look forward to seeing your photos!</p>
